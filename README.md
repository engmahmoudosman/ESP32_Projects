# ESP32 Projects

This repository contains a collection of small ESP32-based projects and experiments I built while exploring embedded programming, PlatformIO, and the Arduino framework.

Each project focuses on a specific concept such as input handling, RGB LED control, serial communication, BLE, FreeRTOS behavior, and general embedded development techniques.

The goal of this repo is to document my learning process, share knowledge, and provide clear, reproducible examples for anyone interested in ESP32 development.

## Repository Structure

Each project is placed in its own folder and includes:

- **Source code** (`src/main.cpp`)
- **PlatformIO configuration** (`platformio.ini`)
- **A descriptive README** explaining the idea, behavior, and key takeaways


---

##  Tools & Frameworks Used

- **ESP32 Dev Boards**
- **PlatformIO** (VS Code)
- **Arduino Framework**
- **Serial Monitor (115200 baud, 8N1)**

##  Example Project Highlight: RGB LED + Button + Serial Interaction

One of the first projects in this repository demonstrates:

-  RGB LED state machine (RED → GREEN → BLUE → …)
-  Button edge detection with software debouncing  
-  Serial interaction (commands and echoing)
-  Sends *“Hello from Mahmoud!”* on button press

This project was built to explore:
- Input handling  
- State transitions  
- Interaction between hardware and serial commands

##  Goals of This Repository

- Build a growing portfolio of embedded development projects  
- Practice clean code organization and documentation  
- Share simple, reproducible examples  
- Strengthen my embedded systems foundation using ESP32
